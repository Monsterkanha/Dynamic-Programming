Smallest sequence with given Primes.

1. Here, I am having three pointer that will tell me the multiplier we need to use for a, b and c respectively.

base case:- dp[0] = 1;
Now, we have dp[i] that will tells what is the number that will come at this place.
We, will have three options. 
dp[i] = min({A*dp[i1], B*dp[i2], C*dp[i3]});
so we will choose the minimum, suppose we have taken something for A then we need to increment this index.


vector<int> Solution::solve(int A, int B, int C, int D) {
    vector<int> dp(D+1,1);
    int i1 = 0, i2 = 0, i3 = 0;
    vector<int> res;
    for(int i = 1; i <= D; i++){
        dp[i] = min({A*dp[i1], B*dp[i2], C*dp[i3]});
        res.push_back(dp[i]);
        if(dp[i] == A*dp[i1])   i1++;
        if(dp[i] == B*dp[i2])   i2++;
        if(dp[i] == C*dp[i3])   i3++;
    }
    return res;
    
}


eg. 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 10   suppose i am this index. next multiple for A could be dp[i1]*A, for B= dp[i2]*B
since we can use only these factors only so this way we can achieve this.
